        "abstract": "This paper introduces SayCan, a framework that grounds large language models in robotic affordances. A pretrained language model suggests high-level actions, while a set of learned skills evaluates the feasibility of these actions. By combining the language model's suggestions with the robot's capabilities, SayCan effectively translates natural language instructions into executable actions, demonstrating improved performance in long-horizon tasks.",

The model is conditioned on 3D point clouds of relevant objects identified by a language model interpreting the natural language instruction. During sampling, a cost function steers the trajectory away from obstacles, enabling zero-shot collision avoidance. Evaluations on various robotic tasks demonstrate the model's effectiveness in generating feasible trajectories in cluttered environments.",

One VAE encodes and reconstructs robot action sequences, while another encodes language descriptions. Sharing a latent space allows for generating corresponding actions from language inputs and vice versa. The enhanced PVAE-BERT incorporates a pretrained BERT encoder, enabling the model to handle unconstrained natural language. Experiments demonstrate the model's ability to generalize to unseen instructions and generate varied action trajectories.",

Evaluations demonstrate that DeComplex effectively translates complex instructions into actionable plans with high accuracy.",

ALFRED includes long, compositional tasks with non-reversible state changes to shrink the gap between research benchmarks and real-world applications. ALFRED consists of expert demonstrations in interactive visual environments for 25k natural language directives. These directives contain both high-level goals like \"Rinse off a mug and place it in the coffee maker.\" and low-level language instructions like \"Walk to the coffee maker on the right.\" ALFRED tasks are more complex in terms of sequence length, action space, and language than existing vision- and-language task datasets. We show that a baseline model based on recent embodied vision-and-language tasks performs poorly on ALFRED, suggesting that there is significant room for developing innovative grounded visual language understanding models with this benchmark.",

The authors propose learning object affordances, action preconditions, and effects through interaction with a visual and dynamic environment. The solution involves bootstrapping reinforcement learning with imitation learning and developing a deep predictive model based on successor representations.
