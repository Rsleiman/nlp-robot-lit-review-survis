  abstract  = {This paper addresses the problem of visual semantic planning: predicting a sequence of actions from visual observations to transform a dynamic environment from an initial state to a goal state. The authors propose learning object affordances, action preconditions, and effects through interaction with a visual and dynamic environment. The solution involves bootstrapping reinforcement learning with imitation learning and developing a deep predictive model based on successor representations. Experimental results show near-optimal performance across a wide range of tasks in the challenging THOR environment.}

It employs natural language processing tools to parse instructions and uses a task-dependency Conditional Random Field (CRF) to infer task ordering. The system leverages a knowledge base of preconditions and postconditions to assemble a control-flow graph plan. Evaluations demonstrate that DeComplex effectively translates complex instructions into actionable plans with high accuracy.}

By interrelating language, perception, and motion during training, the resulting policies can be conditioned at runtime on new human commands, allowing for fine-grained control and reduced ambiguity.

One VAE encodes and reconstructs robot action sequences, while another encodes language descriptions. Sharing a latent space allows for generating corresponding actions from language inputs and vice versa. The enhanced PVAE-BERT incorporates a pretrained BERT encoder, enabling the model to handle unconstrained natural language. Experiments demonstrate the model's ability to generalize to unseen instructions and generate varied action trajectories.}

Evaluations on various robotic tasks demonstrate the model's effectiveness in generating feasible trajectories in cluttered environments.}

ALFRED includes long, compositional tasks with non-reversible state changes to shrink the gap between research benchmarks and real-world applications. ALFRED consists of expert demonstrations in interactive visual environments for 25k natural language directives. These directives contain both high-level goals like "Rinse off a mug and place it in the coffee maker." and low-level language instructions like "Walk to the coffee maker on the right." ALFRED tasks are more complex in terms of sequence length, action space, and language than existing vision- and-language task datasets. We show that a baseline model based on recent embodied vision-and-language tasks performs poorly on ALFRED, suggesting that there is significant room for developing innovative grounded visual language understanding models with this benchmark.}
